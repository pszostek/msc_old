The Linux drivers (that is, kernel modules) are available for download as
binaries, which can be used directly with kernel 2.6.38. It's also fairly
likely that these binaries work with other kernel versions as well.

In order to compile anything for the embedded processor, you'll need the GNU
cross compiler toolchain running on your computer.

See http://www.armadeus.com/wiki/index.php?title=Toolchain for how to set it
up.

Please refer to http://xillybus.com/ in the Documentation section for more
information about how to compile and use these drivers on the i.MX51
platform.
