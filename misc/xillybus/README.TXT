This is bundle for running Xillybus on a Linux machine. Due to its cross-
platform nature, each platform uses a subset of those found here.

Please refer to the documentation at http://xillybus.com for information
about how to run and install the attached software.

This bundle has three subdirectories:

* module - The kernel module source + udev file
* demoapps - Sample C userspace programs for trial and hacking
* diagnostic - A simple diagnostic tool
